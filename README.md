## About

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/72e1086d-6ed0-479e-beb0-ccc360823ebc/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/hopeful-golick-a6c5c0/deploys)

This blog site is a static site running on [Netlify](https://netlify.com), using [Forestry](https://forestry.io/) with [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org). This site is based on @kendallstrautman's [Brevifolia-Gridsome-Forestry](https://github.com/kendallstrautman/brevifolia-gridsome-forestry) starter. For more information on the fundamentals of how the pipeline works, go check it out!

This blog is statically generated by Gridsome, a rendered combination of Vue components and markdown files. It is preconfigured to work with Forestry as a way to manage your content. Forestry makes changes by editing markdown or data files, uploading media to the correct directory and committing these updates to your repo directly.

##  Quick Setup

#### Create and edit content directly on Forestry.io
jamie.sanson.dev uses [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io) as a CMS for the static site.

#### Set-up Locally
In your terminal, navigate to where you would like this blog to live, then run 
```bash
#clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:jamiesanson/jamie.sanson.dev.git

#navigate to the directory
cd "jamie.sanson.dev"

#install dependencies & run dev server with yarn 
yarn install
yarn dev

#or with npm 
npm install
npm run dev
```
A new browser window should open with the dev server running or you can navigate to localhost:8080 

### Plugins

With Gridsome offering a plugin-rich ecosystem, there are a few key plugins that make this project possible. 

- [Gridsome Source Filesystem](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/source-filesystem) transforms local project files into content that can be fetched with GraphQL in the components.
- [Grisome Transformer Remark](https://gridsome.org/plugins/@gridsome/transformer-remark) transforms markdown files.

## Project Structure 

- Site-level configuration is stored in `src/assets/config.json`. This file is loaded in the `gridsome.config.js` to configure Gridsome and allow it to be accessible via metaData in your graphql queries.
- Add and access plugin options or metaData via `gridsome.config.js`.
- Access Gridsome's [server api](https://gridsome.org/docs/server-api) via `gridsome.server.js`. Currently this is just boilerplate. 
- Edit global & reset styles via `src/assets/styles/...`. Edit styles specific to a page or component within the `.vue` file between the `<style>` tags
- `src/assets/content/`contains all your markdown blog posts, images & data files (e.g. authors list, info page data). These are all editable by Forestry. 
- `src/pages` is a very important and required directory for Gridsome. This is where all your pages for the site live. 
- Blog posts are built from a template that can be accessed at `src/templates`. The routing and config for this template lives in `gridsome.config.js` within the `@gridsome/source-filesystem` plugin object.
- The pages & template are comprised of components from `src/components`.
